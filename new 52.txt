--- 2. When I Look Into Your Holiness 
# When I Look Into Your Holiness 
--- 2.1 Verse 1
When I look into Your holiness
When I gaze into Your loveliness 
When all things that surround 
become shadows in the light of You
--- 2.2 Verse 2
When I've found the joy 
of reaching Your heart
When my will becomes 
enthroned in Your love 
When all things that surround 
become shadows in the light of You 
--- 2.3 Chorus
I worship You
I worship You
The reason I live 
is to worship You

# Abba Father
Abba Father, let me be
Yours and Yours alone
May my will forever be
Ever more Your own
Never let my heart grow cold
Never let me go
Abba Father, let me be
Yours and Yours alone
