---- The Heart Of Worship
# The Heart Of Worship
--- [Verse 1]
When the music fades
All is stripped away
And I simply come
Longing just to bring
Something that's of worth
That will bless Your heart
--- [Pre-Chorus]
I'll bring You more than a song
For a song in itself
Is not what You have required
You search much deeper within
Through the way things appear
You're looking into my heart
--- [Chorus]
I'm coming back to 
the heart of worship
**
And it's all about You, 
it's all about You, Jesus
**
I'm sorry, Lord, 
for the thing I've made it
**
When it's all about You, 
it's all about You, Jesus
**
--- [Verse 2]
King of endless worth
No one could express
How much you deserve
Though I'm weak and poor
All I have is Yours
Every single breath

# 点燃
--- Verse1
即使旷野道路 
无力淹没我的心
我要向祢屈膝 
更多寻求祢的心意
求牵引我贴近祢
**
--- Verse2
无论高处低处 
渴望能重新得力
倾倒祢的火焰 
让灰烬能再次燃起
成为焚烧的生命
**
--- Chorus
求祢点燃
**
点燃我们起初为祢 
火热的心
主祢打开天门 
焚烧炼净我们
向我们显明祢心意
**
求祢点燃
**
兴起我的生命成为 
馨香的活祭
主祢彰显大能 
医治释放我们
求祢再次降临 
点燃我的心
--- Bridge
圣灵如风吹起
挑旺信心
呼召因祢烈火
再次燃起
奔向祭坛全然
献上自己
圣灵火降临
