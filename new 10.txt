# 10000 Reasons
--- 2.1 Chorus
Bless the Lord, O my soul
O my soul
worship His holy Name

Sing like never before
O my soul
I’ll worship Your holy Name

--- 2.2 Verse 1
The sun comes up
it’s a new day dawning
It’s time to sing 
Your song again
Whatever may pass 
and whatever lies before me
Let me be singing 
when the evening comes
--- 2.3 Verse 2
You’re rich in love 
and You’re slow to anger
Your Name is great 
and Your heart is kind
For all Your goodness 
I will keep on singing
Ten thousand reasons 
for my heart to find
--- 2.4 Verse 3
And on that day 
when my strength is failing
The end draws near 
and my time has come
Still my soul sings 
Your praise unending
Ten thousand years 
and then forevermore
