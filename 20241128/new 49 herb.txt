---- King of Kings
# King of Kings
--- VERSE 1:
In the darkness we were waiting
Without hope without light
**
Till from heaven You came running
There was mercy in Your eyes
**
To fulfil the law and prophets
To a virgin came the Word
**
From a throne of endless glory
To a cradle in the dirt
**
--- CHORUS:
Praise the Father
Praise the Son
Praise the Spirit three in one
**
God of glory, Majesty
Praise forever to 
the King of Kings
**
--- VERSE 2:
To reveal the kingdom coming
And to reconcile the lost
**
To redeem the whole creation
You did not despise the cross
**
For even in Your suffering
You saw to the other side
**
Knowing this was our salvation
Jesus for our sake You died
**
--- VERSE 3:
And the morning that You rose
All of heaven held its breath
**
Till that stone was moved for good
For the Lamb had conquered death
**
And the dead rose from their tombs
And the angels stood in awe
**
For the souls of all who’d come
To the Father are restored
**
--- VERSE 4:
And the Church of Christ was born
Then the Spirit lit the flame
**
Now this gospel truth of old
Shall not kneel shall not faint
**
By His blood and in His Name
In His freedom I am free
**
For the love of Jesus Christ
Who has resurrected mea
