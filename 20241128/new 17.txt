---- The Heart Of Worship
# The Heart Of Worship
--- [Verse 1]
When the music fades
All is stripped away
And I simply come
Longing just to bring
Something that's of worth
That will bless Your heart
--- [Pre-Chorus]
I'll bring You more than a song
For a song in itself
Is not what You have required
You search much deeper within
Through the way things appear
You're looking into my heart
--- [Chorus]
I'm coming back to 
the heart of worship
**
And it's all about You, 
it's all about You, Jesus
**
I'm sorry, Lord, 
for the thing I've made it
**
When it's all about You, 
it's all about You, Jesus
**
--- [Verse 2]
King of endless worth
No one could express
How much you deserve
Though I'm weak and poor
All I have is Yours
Every single breath
