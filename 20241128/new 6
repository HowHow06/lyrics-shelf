# 在祢没有难成的事 ## Nothing Is Impossible

芥菜种的信心 
可以将大山挪开
相信神的应许 
可以跨越困难
信心的祷告 
神都听见
大声地宣告 
勇敢向前
--- [Chorus]
在祢没有 
没有难成的事
软弱和忧虑中 
祢不曾放弃我
祢的应许 应许 
不论有多少
在基督里
都是阿们

# 我已得自由 ## I Have Been Set Free

在创世以前
天父祂已经爱我
创造我 认识我 
拣选我
差派独生子
耶稣基督 为我舍命
从此进入
永恒爱的约定
--- [Chorus]
我宣告我宣告 
我已得自由
基督福音是大能
要赐给我生命
我宣告我宣告 
我已得自由
基督福音是大能
要赐给我能力
恩典已经来到
救赎真光已照耀 
我宣告 
在基督里我自由
--- [Bridge]
定罪已过去 
控告已过去
基督的宝血
大有能力
罪已得赦免 
旧事已过都变成新
全新的生命 
因耶稣的名

---- King of Kings
# King of Kings
--- VERSE 1:
In the darkness we were waiting
Without hope without light
**
Till from heaven You came running
There was mercy in Your eyes
**
To fulfil the law and prophets
To a virgin came the Word
**
From a throne of endless glory
To a cradle in the dirt
**
--- CHORUS:
Praise the Father
Praise the Son
Praise the Spirit three in one
**
God of glory, Majesty
Praise forever to 
the King of Kings
**
--- VERSE 2:
To reveal the kingdom coming
And to reconcile the lost
**
To redeem the whole creation
You did not despise the cross
**
For even in Your suffering
You saw to the other side
**
Knowing this was our salvation
Jesus for our sake You died
**
--- VERSE 3:
And the morning that You rose
All of heaven held its breath
**
Till that stone was moved for good
For the Lamb had conquered death
**
And the dead rose from their tombs
And the angels stood in awe
**
For the souls of all who’d come
To the Father are restored
**
--- VERSE 4:
And the Church of Christ was born
Then the Spirit lit the flame
**
Now this gospel truth of old
Shall not kneel shall not faint
**
By His blood and in His Name
In His freedom I am free
**
For the love of Jesus Christ
Who has resurrected mea

---- 能不能 Let Me Stay
# 能不能 ## Let Me Stay
--- verse
我属于祢 
祢是我永远的福分
只想日夜在祢殿中
献上敬拜
定睛在祢的荣美 
世上一切变暗淡
除祢以外 
我还能有谁
--- chorus
能不能 就让我
留在祢的同在里
能不能 赐我力量
让我更多爱祢
我哪都不想去 
只想日夜在祢殿中
献上敬拜 
全心全意来爱祢
