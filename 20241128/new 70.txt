---- 主的喜乐是我力量 The Joy of the Lord is My Strength
# 主的喜乐是我力量 ## The Joy of the Lord is My Strength
--- [Verse]
主的喜乐是我力量
祢的救恩是我盼望
虽然橄榄树不效力 
也许葡萄树不结果
我仍因救我的神 
欢欣快乐
--- [Chorus]
我要赞美 
无论得时或不得时
我要赞美 
每天从日出到日落
我心坚定于祢 
每天赞美不停
我要赞美 跳舞赞美
我要赞美 自由赞美
大声欢呼 祢是永远 
得胜君王

---- Who Else
# Who Else
--- verse 1
I am an instrument of exaltation
And I was born to lift Your name 
above all names
**
You hear the melody of all creation
But there's a song of praise 
that only I can bring
**
--- verse 2
You are the infinite God of the ages
Yet You chose to make my heart 
Your dwelling place
**
You healed my brokenness, 
showed me Your glory
**
So I have songs of thanks 
not even angels sing
**
--- chorus
Who else is worthy? 
Who else is worthy?
There is no one, only You, Jesus
**
Who else is worthy? 
Who else is worthy?
There is no one, only You, Jesus
**
--- bridge
Lamb of God, anointed one
Who was and is and is to come
**
Seated on the throne above
Holy, Holy
**
Righteous one who shed His blood
You proved to us the Father's love
**
Jesus Christ be lifted up
Holy, Holy

---- 我心属于祢 My Heart Belongs To You
# 我心属于祢 ## My Heart Belongs To You
--- Verse
我来到祢面前
全心向祢称谢 耶稣
祢是如此爱我
我单单属于祢
--- Chorus
主我在这里
献上我的心
生命的一切
完全献给祢
因为我并没有
财宝和金银
能够献给祢
唯有我的心
我唯一祷告
唯一的呼求
是祢能悦纳
我献上的全所有
愿我这一生成为祢器皿
来完成祢旨意
