# Heart of Worship
--- 3.1 Verse 
When the music fades
All is stripped away
And I simply come
Longing just to bring
Something that's of worth
That will bless Your heart
--- 3.2 Pre-chorus
I'll bring You more than a song
For a song in itself
Is not what You have required
You search much deeper within
Through the way things appear
You're looking into my heart
--- 3.3 Chorus
I'm coming back 
to the heart of worship
And it's all about You
it's all about You, Jesus
I'm sorry, Lord, for 
the thing I've made it
When it's all about You
it's all about You, Jesus
--- 3.4 Verse 2
King of endless worth
No one could express
How much you deserve
Though I'm weak and poor
All I have is Yours
Every single breath!

I love You, Lord
Oh Your mercy never fails me
All my days, I've been 
held in Your hands
From the moment that I wake up
Until I lay my head
Oh, I will sing 
of the goodness of God
--- 4.2 Chorus
Cause all my life 
You have been faithful
And all my life 
You have been so, so good
With every breath 
that I am able
Oh, I will sing 
of the goodness of God

I love Your voice
You have led me through the fire
And in darkest night 
You are close like no other
I've known You as a Father
I've known You as a Friend
And I have lived 
in the goodness of God

Your goodness is running after
it’s running after me 
Your goodness is running after
it’s running after me 
With my life laid down
I’m surrendered now
I give You everything

Your goodness is running after
it’s running after me
