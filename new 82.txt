The tomb is empty; he is not there! The stone is rolled away.
Let all of God’s people rejoice and be glad
For our Savior is risen today!
Behold the promise: he is alive! The chains of death are gone.
Let all of God’s people proclaim the good news
And unite in a jubilant song.
Sing “Alleluia, alleluia!”
Loudly our voices we raise.
Sing “Alleluia, alleluia! Crown Him Lord!” 
Give him glory and praise.
Crown him the Lord of life who triumphs o’er the grave,
And lives victorious in the strife for those he came to save.
Let all creation sing of him who sets us free,
Let all declare him King of kings for all eternity!
The sun is rising: darkness has flown! The earth is now reborn;
And all of God’s people can walk in the light 
of a new and a glorious morn.
Sing “Alleluia, alleluia!”
Loudly our voices we raise.
Sing “Alleluia, alleluia! Crown Him Lord!”
Give him glory! Crown him Lord!
Give him glory! Praise the Lord this Easter Day!
