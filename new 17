You have faced the mountain of desperation,
you have climbed, you have fought, you have won.
But this valley that lies coldly before you
casts a shadow you cannot over come.
And just when you thought had it all together,
You knew evry verse to get you through.
But this time all the sorrow broke more than just your heart,
and reciting all those verses just wont do.
When answers arent enough, there is Jesus.
He is more than just an answer to your prayer.
And your heart will find a safe and peaceful refuge,
When answers arent enough, He is there.
Instead of asking, "Why did it happen",
think of where it can lead you from him.
And as your pain is slowly easin,
you can find a greater reason 
to live your life triumphant through the tears.
When answers arent enough, there is Jesus.
He is more than just an answer to your prayer.
And your heart will find a safe and peaceful refuge,
When answers arent enough, He is there, He is there.
When answers arent enough, there is Jesus.
He is more than just an answer to your prayer.
And your heart will find a safe and peaceful refuge,
When answers arent enough, When answers arent enough, 
When answers arent enough, He is there.
When answers arent enough, He is there.
He is there.
