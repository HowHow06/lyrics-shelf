# How great is our God

The splendor of a king
Clothed in majesty
Let all the earth rejoice
All the earth rejoice
He wraps Himself in light
And darkness tries to hide
And trembles at His voice
Trembles at His voice

How great is our God
Sing with me
How great is our God
And all will see
How great
How great is our God
--- 1.3 Verse 2
Age to age He stands
And time is in His hands
Beginning and the end
Beginning and the end
The Godhead Three in One
Father, Spirit and Son
The Lion and the Lamb
The Lion and the Lamb

Name above all names
Worthy of all praise
My heart will sing
How great is our God
Name above all names
You are worthy of all praise
And my heart will sing
How great is our God


--- 4. Worthy is the Lamb
# Worthy is the Lamb
Thank you for 
the cross, Lord
Thank you for 
the price You paid
Bearing all my 
sin and shame
In love You came
And gave amazing grace
Thank you for 
this love Lord
Thank you for 
the nail pierced hands
Washed me in 
Your cleansing flow
Now all I know
Your forgiveness and embrace
Worthy is the Lamb
Seated on the throne
Crown You now with many crowns
You reign victorious
High and lifted up
Jesus, Son of God
The Darling of Heaven crucified
Worthy is the Lamb
Worthy is the Lamb
