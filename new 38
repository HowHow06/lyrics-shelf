---- Goodness of God
# Goodness of God
--- Verse
I love You, Lord
Oh Your mercy never fails me
All my days, I've been 
held in Your hands
From the moment that I wake up
Until I lay my head
Oh, I will sing 
of the goodness of God
--- Chorus
Cause all my life 
You have been faithful
And all my life 
You have been so, so good
With every breath 
that I am able
Oh, I will sing 
of the goodness of God
--- Verse 2
I love Your voice
You have led me through the fire
And in darkest night 
You are close like no other
I've known You as a Father
I've known You as a Friend
And I have lived 
in the goodness of God
--- Bridge
Your goodness is running after
it’s running after me 
Your goodness is running after
it’s running after me 
With my life laid down
I’m surrendered now
I give You everything
**
Your goodness is running after
it’s running after me
