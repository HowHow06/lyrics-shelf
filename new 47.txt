--- 2. We are the reason
# We are the reason
--- 2.1 Verse 1
As little children 
we would dream of Christmas morn
Of all the gifts and toys 
we knew we'd find
But we never realized 
a baby born one blessed night
Gave us the greatest gift 
of our lives
--- 2.2 Chorus 1
We were the reason 
that He gave His life
We were the reason 
that He suffered and died
To a world that was lost 
He gave all He could give
To show us the reason to live

--- 2.3 Verse 2
As the years went by 
we learned more about gifts
The giving of ourselves 
and what that means
On a dark and cloudy day 
a man hung crying in the rain
All because of love 
all because of love
--- 2.4 Chorus 2
And we were the reason 
that He gave His life
We were the reason 
that He suffered and died
To a world that was lost 
He gave all He could give
To show us the reason to live

--- 2.5 Bridge
I've finally found 
the reason for living
It's in giving 
every part of my heart to Him
In all that I do 
every word that I say
I'll be giving my all 
just for Him, for Him
--- 2.6 Chorus 3
And we are the reason 
that He gave His life
We are the reason 
that He suffered and died
To a world that was lost 
He gave all He could give
To show us the reason to live
He is our reason to live
