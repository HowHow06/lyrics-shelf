每个狂风暴雨里 
祢同在在那里
每个难处低谷里 
祢恩典在那里
每个伤心失望里 
祢爱我爱到底
在祢爱的光中 
我得着能力

我爱祢 用尽我
全心全意全力

我爱祢 用尽我
全心全意全力
在这爱的路程里

四面受敌 
却不被困住
心里作难 
却不至失望
至暂至轻的苦楚要成就
极重无比永远的荣耀

耶和华是我的主 
必不致动摇
有耶和华的帮助 
还要惧谁呢
耶和华是我牧者 
必不致缺乏
有耶和华作我旌旗 
必全然得胜

耶和华是我四围的盾牌 
是我的荣耀

叫我抬起头的神
一宿虽然有哭泣 
早晨我们必欢呼
祢是我的磐石

---- King of Kings
# King of Kings
--- VERSE 1:
In the darkness we were waiting
Without hope without light
**
Till from heaven You came running
There was mercy in Your eyes
**
To fulfil the law and prophets
To a virgin came the Word
**
From a throne of endless glory
To a cradle in the dirt
**
--- CHORUS:
Praise the Father
Praise the Son
Praise the Spirit three in one
**
God of glory, Majesty
Praise forever to 
the King of Kings
**
--- VERSE 2:
To reveal the kingdom coming
And to reconcile the lost
To redeem the whole creation
You did not despise the cross
**
For even in Your suffering
You saw to the other side
Knowing this was our salvation
Jesus for our sake You died
**
--- VERSE 3:
And the morning that You rose
All of heaven held its breath
**
Till that stone was moved for good
For the Lamb had conquered death
**
And the dead rose from their tombs
And the angels stood in awe
**
For the souls of all who’d come
To the Father are restored
**
--- VERSE 4:
And the Church of Christ was born
Then the Spirit lit the flame
**
Now this gospel truth of old
Shall not kneel shall not faint
**
By His blood and in His Name
In His freedom I am free
**
For the love of Jesus Christ
Who has resurrected me
