Praise God from whom all blessings flow
Praise Him, all creatures here below
Praise Him above the Heavenly host
Praise Father, Son and Holy Ghost
Praise God in his sanctuary
Praise him for his mighty acts
Praise him in the firmament of his power
Praise him according to his excellent greatness, Praise him!
I will extol the Lord my God
and I will bless His name forever
Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised
He is righteous and holy
The Lord is gracious and kind
full of compassion, slow to anger
His tender mercies are over all His works
He is good to all
Praise Him! Praise Him! Praise Him! Praise Him!
Praise God in his sanctuary, Praise him for his mighty acts
Praise him in the firmament of his power
Let everything that hath breath
Let everything that hath breath
Let everything that hath breath
Praise the Lord!
Praise God from whom all blessings flow
Praise Him, all creatures here below
Praise Him above the Heavenly host
Praise Father, Son and Holy Ghost
Praise Him! Praise Him!
