# Goodness of God
--- 1.1 Verse 1
I love You, Lord
Oh, Your mercy never fails me
All my days
I've been held in Your hands
From the moment 
that I wake up
Until I lay my head

Oh, I will sing 
of the goodness of God
--- 1.2 Chorus
And all my life 
You have been faithful
And all my life 
You have been so, so good
With every breath 
that I am able
Oh, I will sing 
of the goodness of God
--- 1.3 Verse 2
I love Your voice

You have led me 
through the fire
And in darkest night 
You are close like no other
I've known You as a Father
I've known You as a Friend
And I have lived 
in the goodness of God
--- 1.4 Bridge
'Cause Your goodness 
is running after
it's running after me

Your goodness is running after
it's running after me
With my life laid down
I'm surrendered now
I give You everything

'Cause Your goodness 
is running after
it's running after me

--- 4.1 Verse 1
You call me out 
upon the waters
The great unknown
where feet may fail
And there I find You 
in the mystery
In oceans deep
my faith will stand
--- 4.2 Chorus
And I will call 
upon Your name
And keep my eyes 
above the waves
When oceans rise, my soul 
will rest in Your embrace
For I am Yours 
and You are mine
--- 4.3 Verse 2
Your grace abounds 
in deepest waters
Your sovereign hand 
will be my guide
Where feet may fail 
and fear surrounds me
You've never failed 
and You won't start now
--- 4.4 Bridge
Spirit lead me where 
my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters 
wherever You would call me
Take me deeper than my feet 
could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger 
in the presence of my Saviour
