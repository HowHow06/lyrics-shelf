#  dang ni qi qiu zai shu  ## When You Prayed Beneath The Trees
When you prayed beneath the trees,
it was for me, O Lord;
when you cried upon your knees,
how could it be, O Lord?
When in blood and sweat and tears
you dismissed your final fears,
when you faced the soldiers' spears,
you stood for me, O Lord.
When their triumph looked complete,
it was for me, O Lord,
when it seemed like your defeat,
they could not see, O Lord!
When you faced the mob alone
you were silent as a stone,
and a tree became your throne;
you came for me, O Lord.
When you stumbled up the road,
you walked for me, O Lord,
when you took your deadly load,
that heavy tree, O Lord;
When they lifted you on high,
and they nailed you up to die,
and when darkness filled the sky,
it was for me, O Lord.
