--- 2. Shout to the Lord
# Shout to the Lord
--- 2.1 Verse 1
My Jesus, my Savior
Lord, there is none like You
All of my days, I want to praise
The wonders of Your mighty love
--- 2.2 Verse 2
My comfort, my shelter
Tower of refuge and strength
Let every breath, all that I am
Never cease to worship You
--- 2.3 Chorus
Shout to the Lord
All the earth let us sing
Power and majesty 
praise to the King
Mountains bow down 
and the seas will roar
At the sound 
of Your name
I sing for joy 
at the work of Your hands
Forever I'll love You
forever I'll stand
Nothing compares to the 
promise I have in You
